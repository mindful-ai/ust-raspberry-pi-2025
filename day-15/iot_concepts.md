## 1. What is IoT?
A network of interconnected devices capable of collecting and exchanging data using embedded sensors, actuators, and communication technologies.

## 2. Characteristics of IoT
- Interconnectivity
- Heterogeneity
- Dynamic changes
- Scalability
- Intelligence (AI + IoT)

## 3. IoT Architecture
- Perception Layer: Sensors and actuators
- Network Layer: Transmitting data
- Application Layer: End-user applications

## 4. Sensors and Actuators
- Sensors detect changes (e.g., temperature, motion)
- Actuators perform actions (e.g., motors, valves)

## 5. Embedded Systems
- Devices with dedicated functions within a larger system
- Usually constrained in power and memory

## 6. Edge Computing
- Data processing near the source (e.g., local gateways)
- Reduces latency and bandwidth usage

## 7. Fog Computing
- Layer between edge and cloud
- Offers distributed computing, storage, and network services

## 8. Cloud Computing in IoT
- Provides scalable storage, processing, and analytics capabilities

## 9. IoT Communication Models
- Device-to-Device
- Device-to-Cloud
- Device-to-Gateway
- Back-End Data-Sharing

## 10. Protocols Used in IoT
### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
- Lightweight publish/subscribe protocol
- Ideal for low-bandwidth, high-latency networks

### CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)
- Designed for constrained devices
- Based on REST model over UDP

### HTTP/HTTPS
- Widely used web protocol
- Heavy for constrained devices but useful for integration

### AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)
- Message-oriented middleware protocol
- Ensures reliability and security

### WebSockets
- Full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection
- Useful for real-time communication

### LoRaWAN
- Long range, low power wide area network protocol
- Suitable for remote sensors

### Zigbee
- Short-range, low-power mesh network
- Common in smart home devices

### BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
- Energy-efficient wireless communication
- Used in fitness trackers, beacons

### NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)
- Cellular-based, low power wide area technology
- Ideal for deep indoor coverage

### 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks)
- Adaptation layer allowing IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4

## 11. Device Management
- Provisioning, configuration, and maintenance
