| **Addressing**                | No (direct peer-to-peer)                               | No (individual SS lines per slave)       | Yes (uses unique addresses per device)    |
| **Clock Required**            | No                                                     | Yes (provided by master)                 | Yes (provided by master)                  |
| **Data Acknowledgment**       | No                                                     | No                                       | Yes (ACK/NACK)                            |

| **Use Case**                  | GPS, Bluetooth modules, basic serial logging           | Display drivers, flash memory, sensors   | Real-time clocks, EEPROM, multiple sensors|
| **Distance**                  | Short to moderate (few meters)                         | Short (typically < 1 meter)              | Short (up to a few meters)                |
| **No. of Devices**            | 2 (one TX, one RX)                                     | Limited by available SS pins             | 1008 slaves (theoretically)               |

## âœ… Recommendations

- **Use UART** when:  
  You need simple, low-speed, peer-to-peer communication (e.g., debugging, GPS modules).

- **Use SPI** when:  
  Speed is critical and you have few devices (e.g., OLED displays, flash memory).

- **Use I2C** when:  
  You want to connect many low-speed peripherals with fewer pins (e.g., sensors, RTCs).
